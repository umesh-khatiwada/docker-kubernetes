The provided format for creating a Docker volume and running a container with it attached is mostly correct, but there are a couple of minor improvements:

1. **Indentation:**  The detail section with the `docker inspect` output uses a single level of indentation.  For better readability, consider indenting this section further (typically 2 or 4 spaces) to visually distinguish it from the steps.

2. **Optional Step:**  While not strictly necessary, you might consider adding a step between Step 2 and Step 3 to **verify the volume creation**.  You can achieve this with:

    ```bash
    docker volume inspect nginx_volume
    ```

This command will display details about the newly created volume `nginx_volume`.

Here's the improved format incorporating these suggestions:

**Step 1: Create a Docker Volume**
`docker volume create nginx_volume`

**Step 2: Run a Docker Container with the Volume Attached**
`docker run -d --name nginx_container -v nginx_volume:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx`

**Step 3 (Optional): Verify Volume Creation**
`docker volume inspect nginx_volume`

**Step 3: Verify the Volume is Attached**
```docker inspect nginx_container

# Detail section with indented output
"Mounts": [
    {
        "Type": "volume",
        "Name": "nginx_volume",
        "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx_volume/_data",
        "Destination": "/usr/share/nginx/html",
        ...
    }
]
```
This revised format maintains the clarity of the original instructions while enhancing readability and potentially adding a helpful verification step.
