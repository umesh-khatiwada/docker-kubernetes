The `docker-compose up --build` command is a powerful tool in Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications. Let's break down what it does:

**1. Building Images (if necessary):**

- Docker Compose first checks for the images defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If an image doesn't already exist, and the service has a `Dockerfile` in its build context, `docker-compose up --build` will initiate a build process.
- It uses the `Dockerfile` instructions to create a new image specific to that service.

**2. Starting and Attaching Containers:**

- Once any necessary images are built, `docker-compose up --build` starts containers for each defined service in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- By default, the command attaches to the container's standard output, allowing you to see logs and console output from the running service.

**3. Stopping Containers (on exit):**

- When you exit the terminal session running `docker-compose up --build`, all the started containers are gracefully stopped.

**In essence, this command helps you:**

- Build any missing images needed for your application.
- Start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- See the real-time output from your running containers.

**Here are some additional points to remember:**

- You can use `docker-compose up` without `--build` if your images are already built. This will only start the containers.
- For detached execution (containers run in the background), use `docker-compose up -d --build`.

I hope this explanation clarifies the functionality of `docker-compose up --build`!
